# Scriptable

Scripts and widgets for the iOS Scriptable App



## iTerm Widget

Inspired by [evandcoleman](https://github.com/evandcoleman/scriptable), but re-written for my own data.

Currently, this widget shows information about: 

- Device battery level
- Location
- Date
- Today progress
- Year progress
- Weather

### How to use

Copy both iTerm Widget.js and Cache.js into your Scriptable iCloud Drive folder and modify the values at the top of iTerm Widget.js.
